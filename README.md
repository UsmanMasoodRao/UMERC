Control Framework Design for Wave Energy Converters with Direct Drive Linear Generator-Based Power Take-Off Systems
This open-source codebase presents a control framework for ocean wave energy converters (WECs) equipped with Direct Drive Linear Generator (DDLG)-based power take-off (PTO) systems.

The project focuses on advanced control design, particularly Sliding Mode Control (SMC), to maximize energy extraction while ensuring system robustness under highly variable ocean conditions. The framework supports the development of power solutions for Powering the Blue Economy (PBE) applications in remote maritime environments.
